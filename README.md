## Inspiration

I want to procedurally generate a skill tree based on the number of powers and upgrades that exist for Scry's upcoming game Rapture. I thought I'd try my hand at building these circles to see how feasable such a thing would be.

Inspiration for rune generation pulled from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/5wzo7j/monthly_challenge_16_march_2017_procedural_runes/).
